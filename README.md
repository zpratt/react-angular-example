React Angular Example
---

[See the live example](http://zpratt.github.io/react-angular-example/app/).

The README (and the project itself) is a work in progress. Here's the gist:

This project illustrates how to use the following things:

* Angular - provides the backend of the front-end and some DOM glue
* React - provides the view layer, thanks to [ngReact](https://github.com/davidchang/ngReact)
* es6 - simple angular and react es6 modules
* webpack - simple build process thanks to [hjs-webpack](https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/hjs-webpack)

## To run examples

1. clone the project
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Start the webpack dev server: `npm start`
- open a browser to [view the example](http://localhost:3000/webpack-dev-server/)
